# Advent of Code 2023

Another year, another Rust attempt!

This year I'll be using copilot to see how much it speeds me up, what parts almost seem like cheating, and if it helps me get_shit_done! Usually I give up early into the process, so I'm hoping this year I can take it further than I've gone before!
